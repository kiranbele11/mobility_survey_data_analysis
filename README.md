The Mobility Survey Data Analysis Project is an initiative taken by CEEW - Council on Energy, Environment, and Water to understand the transportation needs and challenges faced by the people of Delhi. The survey collected data from residents of Delhi through a questionnaire, which covered a wide range of topics related to transportation and mobility. These include modes of transportation used, frequency of travel, travel time, and any challenges or issues encountered while travelling.

The goal of this project is to analyze this data and gain insights into the transportation situation in Delhi. The insights obtained from this project can be used to identify areas for improvement and inform policy decisions related to transportation in Delhi.

This project is expected to be useful for various stakeholders such as city planners, transportation authorities, and researchers, who are interested in understanding the transportation needs and challenges of a city, and how to improve it.
